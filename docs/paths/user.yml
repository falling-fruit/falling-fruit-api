    - If a new email is provided, it is staged as unconfirmed (`unconfirmed_email`) and a confirmation email is sent to the new email. The previous email is replaced only once the new email is confirmed.
    - If a password is provided, it takes immediate effect. If it does not match the previous password, all refresh tokens not corresponding to the current access token are revoked.
    - In either case, the existing password is required (`password_confirmation`).
