  summary: Fetch Location changes (activity).
  description: |
    A change event is recorded when a location is added (`'added'`), a location is edited (`'edited'`), or a location is reviewed (`'visited'`). Results are sorted in reverse chronological order (most recent first).

    Filtering by user `id` is forbidden if the user is anonymous (`name` is null). Filtering by user `range` is restricted to the user.
