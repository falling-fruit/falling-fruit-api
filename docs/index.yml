  title: Falling Fruit API
  description: |
    Falling Fruit is an open-technology nonprofit mapping the world's edible plants and developing online platforms to promote urban foraging and hyperlocal food. This API provides access to the Falling Fruit database. It is a work in progress and does not provide access to all possible database tables or fields. Many features on the website (https://fallingfruit.org) still rely on the older Rails API.

    ### General usage

    - GET requests rely on path and query parameters.
    - POST and PUT requests rely on path parameters and body content. If the request includes a file, a `multipart/form-data` body is used with a `json` key (if needed) whose value is a JSON-formatted string; otherwise, raw JSON is used.
    - The values of array query parameters are comma-delimited, e.g. `types=1,2,3`, and arrays of arrays are pipe-delimited, e.g. `bounds=-85,-180|85,180`.
    - All endpoints return JSON responses.
    - Success and error responses use conventional HTTP status codes: `2xx` for success (implemented: `200`), `4xx` for incorrect requests (implemented: `400`, `401`, `403`), and `5xx` for server errors (not implemented). `4xx` errors will typically include an error message.

    ### Security

    - All endpoints (other than `GET` endpoints intended for email links) require authentication via an API key (header `x-api-key`).
    - `POST` and `PUT` requests may accept (or require) an access token (header `Authorization: Bearer {token}`), in which case the action is associated with that user.
    - Access tokens are acquired by submitting registered user credentials (`email` and `password`).

    ### TODO

    - Security
      - Require a reCAPTCHA for `POST` and `PUT` requests without a token (https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/docs/verify, https://www.twilio.com/blog/2017/08/http-requests-in-node-js.html, https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-recaptcha).
      - Add session endpoints `POST /user/session`, `DELETE /user/session` (?).
    - Public endpoints
      - View recent changes (https://fallingfruit.org/changes).
    - User endpoints
      - View user activity (https://fallingfruit.org/home).
      - Change and confirm email.
      - Delete account with `DELETE /user`.
      - Change password while logged in (?).
    - I/O:
      - Translate emails, errors, and messages (https://github.com/lingui/js-lingui, https://github.com/phrase/phrase-cli).
      - Return `5xx` for server errors, currently included in `400`.
      - Validate requests, and responses in development (https://github.com/cdimascio/express-openapi-validator).
      - Return coded error objects for client-side translation to the user.

    description: |-
      Clusters reduce the Locations in an area to a count and a center of mass. They are computed on a nested [quadtree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadtree) which, for a given zoom level, divides the Earth into a 2<sup>zoom</sup> x 2<sup>zoom</sup> grid of equal-sized squares in the Web Mercator projection (EPSG:3857).

      Note that Clusters count the number of Location Types, not Locations. So, for example, a Location with two Types is counted twice.
